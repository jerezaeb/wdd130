      <h3>Betta</h3>
      <p>
        Bettas are also referred as “Siamese fighting fish” or “labyrinth fish,” their scientific name is Betta splendens.  They were discovered in Thailand over 150 years ago. These are territorial fish in rice paddies and still watered canals. The betta breed were later studied and they came up with beautiful colors and fins. They are now considered as the most popular and beautiful pet fish in the world. They have a wide range of color and fin types including double tail, veil, delta, halfmoon, crowntail and many more.  Today, there are about 73 species of betta in the world.</p>

      <p>White other fish are known to live or travel in large pack or school, betta prefers to be independent both in wild and in fish tanks. Female bettas can live together in larger groups in the same tank but with caution as they may also have the tendency to fight with each other.</p>
        
      <p>To survive in the warm, oxygen-poor habitats, bettas have a unique organ called the labyrinth to breathe air above water surface. Because of this ability, some people believe bettas can be kept in small bowls or flower vases. </p>
        
      <p>Like other fish pets, bettas should be kept in a filtered aquarium and at a temperature between 76° and 84° F. </p>
